/// In normal, safe code, the compiler inserts calls to destructors at the end of object's
/// lifetimes, e.g,
///
/// ----
/// {
///     let x = X;
/// }
/// ----
///
/// inserts a call to the `X` destructor at the end of the block. However, the compiler
/// cannot do this if it doesn't know the lifetime of an object. This happens when you use
/// raw pointers which opt out of lifetimes. In those cases it is the job of the
/// programmer to insert destructor calls. For example, a vector looks roughly like this:
///
/// ----
/// struct Vec<T> {
///     ptr: *mut T,
///     len: usize,
///     cap: usize,
/// }
/// ----
///
/// Since the `T`s contained in the vector are behind a raw pointer, the compiler does not
/// destroy them automatically at the end of their lifetime. The author of the `Vec`
/// structure has to manually call the destructor for all of its `T` objects in the
/// destructor of `Vec`:
///
/// ----
/// fn drop(&mut self) {
///     for i in 0..self.len {
///         unsafe {
///             // Bring the contained object back from behind the pointer so that it's
///             // once again managed by the compiler which will call the destructor of
///             // `_t` at the end of the `unsafe` block.
///             let _t = ptr::read(self.ptr.add(i));
///         }
///     }
///     // Deallocate `self.ptr` here
///     // ...
/// }
/// ----
///
/// In the case of vectors this is very easy: Since the lifetime of the vector is always
/// shorter than the lifetime of the contained objects, we can rely on the `drop` code
/// above running before the end of the lifetimes of the `T`.
///
/// There are, however, some data structures for which this is not easy. For example, the
/// destructor of `Rc` looks like this:
///
/// ----
/// fn drop(&mut self) {
///     self.number_of_references -= 1;
///     if self.number_of_references == 0 {
///         // Call the destructor of the contained object
///     }
/// }
/// ----
///
/// As you can see, we don't always call the destructor of the contained object at the end
/// of the lifetime of the `Rc`. At first it seems that this is no problem since, in order
/// to have `number_of_references > 1` you have to have cloned the `Rc` and all of the
/// clones are bound by the lifetime of `T`. Once the last cloned `Rc` is dropped, it
/// should call the destructor of the `T`.
///
/// But this doesn't account for the possibility of cycles. If we put a clone of the `Rc`
/// into the `Rc` itself, then the destructor that destroys the last `Rc` clone will never
/// run and thus the `T` will never be destroyed. Here is an example that generates such a
/// cycle:
///
/// ----
/// struct T;
///
/// impl Drop for T {
///     fn drop(&mut self) {
///         println!("dropped");
///     }
/// }
///
/// struct X<T> {
///     _t: T,
///     rc: Option<Rc<RefCell<X<T>>>>,
/// }
///
/// fn main() {
///     let rc = Rc::new(RefCell::new(X { _t: T, rc: None }));
///     rc.borrow_mut().rc = Some(rc.clone());
/// }
/// ----
///
/// You will notice that the `dropped` message will never be printed even though the end
/// of the lifetime of `T` is reached at the end of the `main` block.
///
/// Most of the time this is not a problem, even if destructors don't run, this cannot
/// cause memory unsafety. However, the safety of some structures depends on the guarantee
/// that destructors run at the end of object's lifetimes. For example, the `JoinGuard`
/// returned by `thread::scoped` must have its destructor run at the end of its lifetime
/// or the behavior is undefined.
///
/// For this reason we introduce the `Leak` trait which marks objects that don't need to
/// have their destructor run at the end of their lifetime. By default, every object is
/// `Leak`. If your object contains an object that is `!Leak`, then it's automatically
/// `!Leak` itself but you can opt into `Leak` by implementing `Leak` explicitly. If you
/// want to explicitly opt out of `Leak`, then you have to implement `!Leak` for your
/// object. For example, `JoinGuard` explicitly implements `!Leak`.
///
/// If you create a new container such as `Vec` or `Rc` which owns objects behind raw
/// pointers and if you cannot guarantee that the object's destructors will be run at the
/// end of their lifetimes, then you have to add the `Leak` bound to your trait bounds.
/// For example, the `Rc` type can be defined as follows:
///
/// ----
/// struct Rc<T: Leak> {
///     data: *mut Inner<T>,
/// }
/// ----
///
/// where `Inner<T>` is an allocated object that contains the `T` and the reference count.
///
/// The simple criterion is as follows:
///
/// **If the destructor of your object calls the destructor of the contained object only
/// if a certain condition is met, add the `Leak` bound.**
